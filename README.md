# CanSatDashboard

This project is to build a web dashboard for logging data from wireless robotics devices.

The first goal to make this device is making a realtime data logger for [CanSat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CanSat#:~:targetText=A%20CanSat%20is%20a%20type,atmosphere%2C%20nor%20orbited%20the%20earth). 

## Cansat
A CanSat is a type of sounding rocket payload used to teach space technology. 
It is similar to the technology used in miniaturized satellites. 
No CanSat has ever left the atmosphere, nor orbited the earth.

In CanSat competitions, the payload is required to fit inside the volume of a typical soda can 
(66mm diameter and 115mm height) and have a mass below 350g.Antennas can be mounted externally, 
but the diameter can't increase until the CanSat has left the launch vehicle. 
The CanSats are deployed from small rocket at height which varies depending on the competition.
CanSats are equipped with a recovery system, usually a parachute, to limit damage upon recovery and to 
allow the CanSat to be reused. CanSats are used to teach space technology, because of their inexpensive price 
and small volume.
